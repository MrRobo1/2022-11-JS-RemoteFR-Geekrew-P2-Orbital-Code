You can contact them directly. In this group, you will be informed of new destinations, upcoming departures, useful information about our trips... and above all, you will be able to find your future travel buddies (for more information on this subject, you will see a post about it on our group). In any case, 30 days before departure, your trip coordinator will create a WhatsApp group with all the participants... just to get the trip off to a good start!',
